<node> <text> Out of the shadows emerges an winged insect. Ornate antennae
dangle in in front of its face, most of which is taken up by massive compound
eyes and complex looking mouth parts. Silken fur covers its hard exoskeleton.
Stationary it might look pretty, but it moves its six legs with the clumsiness
of a toddler. </text> <id> 1 </id>

  <node> <text> As you speak those words you realise you have the same insecty
  voice as the moth in front of you. You look down and see segmented legs full
  of inhuman angles. As your eyes adjust to the darkness you also realise you
  can only see in black and white. You become aware of muscles and joints you
  never had before. It appears that you are, in fact, a moth. </text> <id> 7

    <node> <text> "There must be some way. Maybe if you explore you can find a
    way. The only useful information I can give you is that behind the clock is
    a spool of thread. Perhaps other moths know clues as well." </text> <id> 9

      fruit become more moth-like with every bite. Those who have been here the
      longest you can't even talk to, they have forgotten human language. But
      eat it we must. There's no other food. And it's so ...
      delicious."</text><id> 10</id> <response> <text> I hope I find a way out ...
