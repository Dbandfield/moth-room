<node> <text> Out of the shadows emerges an winged insect. Ornate antennae
dangle in in front of its face, most of which is taken up by massive compound
eyes and complex looking mouth parts. Silken fur covers its hard exoskeleton.
Stationary it might look pretty, but it moves its six legs with the clumsiness
of a toddler. </text> <id> 1 </id>

  <node> <text> As you speak those words you realise you have the same insecty
  voice as the moth in front of you. You look down and see segmented legs full
  of inhuman angles. As your eyes adjust to the darkness you also realise you
  can only see in black and white. You become aware of muscles and joints you
  never had before. It appears that you are, in fact, a moth. </text> <id> 7

    The moth flaps over to the nearby clock and squeezes behind to fetch the thread.
    He emerges covered in thick, grey dust. Together, you lower it into the lamp
    and the trapped moth grabs on, towing the letter behind her. "Thank you
